# April 2021 Cohort Capstone Requirements
Requirements for the Digital Crafts April Capstone Project

Requirements
* You have two weeks (and a few days) to make something incredible to show the world at Demo Day!
* Our demo day is the evening of **October 26, 2021**

This project is fairly open-ended, but this project should sell your technical skills to your colleagues and potential employers, so:
* It should demonstrate your technical expertise. If you want a job in web development, do a project that demonstrates your JavaScript + web stack skills.
* It should be ambitious: cookie-cutter todo apps or blogs probably won't help you land a great position.
* Start with the user-centered design process. This will help employers recognize your ability to set priorities in light of user needs!
Heads-up: If you don’t participate in the capstone project (or make trivial contributions and disappear), you will not receive a DigitalCrafts certificate or be a DigitalCrafts graduate.
 
Note
Your technical decisions are entirely up to you. This is your project. It's possible that you might choose a tech stack that is outside the Digital Crafts curriculum.  Your instructor will do whatever they can to help you, but understand that they might not have expertise with that particular tech stack.

Front-end Requirements
You must have a UI of some kind! But you can build using any number of technologies. Here are some ideas:
* React, React Native, ReactVR
* Hardware based (motion, gesture, or voice activated)
* Electron (HTML/CSS/JavaScript apps for the desktop)
If you are building a UI for the browser:
* fetch (or Axios (Links to an external site.) ) is recommended for AJAX.
* It must be responsive.

Backend Requirements
* You are free to build a backend in any technology you choose!
    * Node.js is the most obvious choice, but you are welcome to build using Python, Ruby, Java, C#/.NET, Go, Elixir, etc.
* You must have a database.
    * PostgreSQL is recommended, but you are free to use MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, or other ones.
* It is recommended your site is protected with an SSL certificate. (Using Certbot is the best/free choice).
    * Projects can be hosted locally for Demo Day, but will need to be deployed after.  

⭐️⭐️⭐️ Important ⭐️⭐️⭐️
You must provide DigitalCrafts a one-page summary of your project with technologies used and your reasoning behind each.
This should double as your README.md on Github. (see note below regarding a technical writer
 (Links to an external site.)
).
Your final project must be publicly available on Github, include the README file, be hosted publicly, and featured on your portfolio.
Your demo must be recorded.
We will present these videos on Demo Day.
There will not be live presentations.

⭐️⭐️ Demo Video Requirements ⭐️⭐️
Present your project.
Think of it is as a "pitch."
Every group member will need to speak.
It's recommended to write a "script" for each person to read.

Group Requirements
2 Groups will be comprised of 4 people. 
* One group member will take the role of Project Manager/Scrum Master.
    * The PM will be the primary point of contact for each group.
* One group member will be a Technical Writer responsible for documentation for the application.
    * They will work closely with the PM to make sure the features are properly documented as they're implemented.
Both the Technical Writer and the PM can (and should) take an active role in development. However, these will be secondary contributions.

⭐️ Do and Do Not ⭐️
DO
* Build the app around solving a problem.
* COMMUNICATE early, and often!
* Keep it SIMPLE! (No swords where butter knives will do!)
DO NOT
* Shoehorn a problem into a tech stack.
* Fall in love with your code (because it's gonna change!).
* Work in a silo and forget to talk to people.

Workflow Requirements
* Create Github repo (add all group members as collaborators)
* Collaborate using PRs (Pull Requests). 
    * You’ll thank yourself when things break, and employers see how well you use Github.
* As a group, the reviewer must code review through Github and approve before the PR can be merged.
    * If there are no comments, the code has spaghetti, or has difficult to read spots, code review didn't happen.
* You must use some kind of project planning software (such as trello.com (Links to an external site.)  or Github).

PR Rejection Criteria
* Does not fulfill feature
* Breaks other feature
* Inconsistent use of JavaScript language features (e.g. mixing var and let).
* Does not follow team's coding style/standards
* Copy & paste (wholesale copying of another project without reference)
* Too many commits in a single PR (meaning too much to review)
* Code in a commit does not match commit message
* Commit message is vague
